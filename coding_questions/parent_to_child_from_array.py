‚ùì PROMPT
Given an array of arrays representing relations  *child, parent1,
and parent2* in each row, print a string representing all children
of each parent.

For example: *Ben is the parent of James, Jen*. The formatting
doesn't matter as long as all children are represented in the
final output. You will need to return the entire result as
strings separated by newlines to match against the strings
in these comparisons accurately.

return parentRelationships.join("\n") //javascript
return "\n".join(parentRelationships) #python

Example(s)
Input: []
Output: 'No family relations'

Input: [
  ["James", "Ben", "Lisa"],
  ["George", "Taylor", "Fred"],
  ["Jen", "Ben", "Gloria"]
]
Output:
'Ben is the parent of James, Jen'
'Lisa is the parent of James'
'Taylor is the parent of George'
'Fred is the parent of George'
'Gloria is the parent of Jen'

üîé EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
A single array from the matrix will be of length <= 3
Key: Parent, Value: Child
What if a child has no parents? This should probably throw an error

Insightful & revealing test cases:


üß† BRAINSTORM
What approaches could work?
Algorithm 1:
Time: O()
Space: O()
 

üìÜ PLAN
Outline of algorithm #:
- Iterate through each element in the input array.
- for each element, indices 1 and 2 will be treated as keys.
Index 1 will be added to the hashmap
- after parsing the input matrix, print the results "{key} is the parent of {value1}, {value2}, ..."
